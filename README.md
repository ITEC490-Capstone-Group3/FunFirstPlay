Capstone Assumptions:

The backend will be built separately using Express. It will use a Postgres database and knex to make queries. It will use cors and helmet middleware for protection against attacks. It will use body-parser to parse request bodies, dotenv to protect environment variables, morgan to log requests, and nodemon to watch for changes in the dev environment.
